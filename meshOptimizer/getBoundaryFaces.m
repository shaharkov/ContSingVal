function [F,inds] = getBoundaryFaces(T,keep)
% Compute the boundary faces F of the given tetrahedral mesh 
% keep is an optional boolean vector that forces to keep all faces of 
% any tet that its corresponding entry in "keep" is non-zero
%returns: 
%F: n x 3 array of all faces from T that are boundary or belong to a tet
% that is marked as 1 in "keep".
%inds(i)==k iff the the boundary face F(i,:) belongs to the tetrahedron 
%T(k,:)
